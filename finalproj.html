        <b>Introduction:</b><br> </font>
        <font size="4">
            Neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease impact millions globally, 
        necessitating early detection for effective intervention. Additionally, 
        sudden strokes, resulting from abnormal brain activity, cause significant 
        mortality. Addressing these challenges, our project employs data analysis 
        and machine learning techniques to assess the predictive accuracy of 
        identifying potential disorders. <br><br>

        <b>Project Objective:</b><br></font>
        <font size="4">
            The primary goal of the project is to develop a predictive tool for 
        neurological disorder detection, using data analysis and machine learning 
        methodologies. Our focus is on assessing the accuracy of predictions rather 
        than relying solely on brain images. <br><br>

        <b>Dataset Utilization:</b><br></font>
        <font size="4">
            We leverage the OASIS dataset, known for its rich neurological research data. 
            This dataset contains a variety of attributes relevant to neurological disorders, 
            allowing us to evaluate the predictive capabilities of different machine learning models. <br><br>
        </font>
       
        <font color="#1F6E8C" size="5">
        <b>Methodology:</b><br></font>
        <font size="4">
            Through the utilization of Machine Learning, we create predictive models trained 
        to assess the likelihood of a neurological disorder based on provided attributes. 
        Our emphasis is on evaluating the accuracy of these models in making predictions. <br><br>

        <font color="#1F6E8C" size="5">
        <b>Machine Learning Algorithms:</b><br></font>
        <font size="4">
            We employ a comprehensive set of machine learning algorithms to accomplish our 
            accuracy assessment. These include: <br><br>
            <list>
       
                <li>Decision Trees <br></li>
                <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM) <br></li>
                <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                <li>AdaBoost </li>
                <li>Random Forest</li>
                <li>Extra Trees</li>
                <li>
                    Gradient Boosting</li>
                    <li>XGBoost</li>
            </list>

        <b>Accuracy Assessment:</b> <br></font>
        <font size="4">
        The core objective of our project is to measure how accurately the models can 
        predict the presence or absence of neurological disorders. We employ metrics 
        such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to comprehensively assess 
        the performance of our models. <br><br>
        </font>
        

        <font color="#1F6E8C" size="5">
        <b>Application:</b> <br></font>
        <font size="4">
            Our models serve as a preliminary screening tool for healthcare professionals.
         By inputting patient attributes into the trained models, practitioners can gauge 
         the likelihood of neurological disorders. Understanding the accuracy of these predictions 
         can guide medical decisions regarding further diagnostics and treatment strategies. <br><br>

        <b>Conclusion:</b> <br></font>
        <font size="4">
            This project revolves around measuring the accuracy of predictive models for neurological 
        disorder detection, utilizing a range of machine learning algorithms. While diverging from 
        traditional brain image analysis, our commitment to improving early detection and healthcare 
        outcomes remains resolute. <br> <br>

        <b>Future Directions:</b> <br></font>
        <font size="4">
            In the future, refining our models and exploring additional datasets could lead to more accurate
         predictions. Collaboration with medical professionals and institutions can provide valuable insights 
         for practical implementation. <br>
